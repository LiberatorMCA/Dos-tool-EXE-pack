# Dos-tool-EXE-pack
These are Dos tools I have obtained over the past year from all kinds of sites, networks, etc. It is not Python. Almost all tools detected as Trojan but normal UI launches. If you are really worried, run it in the Windows Sandbox. Comments and ratings.
I have run all the tools and kept them for several months with no effect on my laptop. If you have an anti-virus, set the action in the settings to move to quarantine instead of delete if detected. Before you know it, critical components of the DosTools will be removed and may not work properly.

I just found out that you should turn off the firewall of your anti-virus software during a Dos attack. They will limit your bandwidth and slow down the speed of the Dos attack by 3 times or more than it should be.
To elaborate, anti-viruses examine outgoing and incoming packets, which is why they slow down the communication speed.
In addition, since Dos attacks send many packets, the anti-virus uses a huge amount of CPU resources to examine the many packets. This can result in a system freeze or a system crash due to CPU overload during a Dos attack.
