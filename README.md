# Dos-tool-EXE-pack
These are Dos tools I have obtained over the past year from all kinds of sites, networks, etc. It is not Python. Almost all tools detected as Trojan but normal UI launches. If you are really worried, run it in the Windows Sandbox. Comments and ratings.
I have run all the tools and kept them for several months with no effect on my laptop. If you have an anti-virus, set the action in the settings to move to quarantine instead of delete if detected. Before you know it, critical components of the DosTools will be removed and may not work properly.

ComodoAntiVirus is an anti-virus that runs in the cloud, unlike AVG-Avast and others. It is one of my preferred anti-virus. It works quickly even in resource-intensive environments. It can constantly monitor network connections, etc., and can run untrusted software in a virtual box. Many people don't like this anti-virus, but I like it.

The Comodo installation has an error the first few times, but after redoing it, the installation completes successfully.
